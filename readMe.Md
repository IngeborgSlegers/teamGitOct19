Welcome to your first interaction with TEAM GIT!

To kick things off, find a friend (or classmate) and team up with them. After that, clone this project. If you can't remember how, ask your trusty friend Google or pull a classmate aside for some help.

The person who cloned this project wil then share their GitHub handle with me so I can add you as a collaborator.

Go Team Git!
